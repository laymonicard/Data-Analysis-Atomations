This repository focuses on scripts in any language I create to help folks who need to automate their data analysis processes. This need is especially common in the office setting, where many people still depend on Excel to manage large amount of data.
Based on my personal experience, while extremely useful, Excel often has limited capabilities to support users who need to process data that are more than 100,000 rows (e.g., it crashes frequently). 
Feel free to use codes in this repository for personal or office purpose.
