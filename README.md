This repository focuses on scripts in any language I create to help folks who need to automate their data analysis processes. This need is widespread in the office setting, where many people still depend on Excel to manage large amounts of data.
Based on my personal experience, while extremely useful, Excel often has limited capabilities to support users who need to process data that are more than 100,000 rows (e.g., it crashes frequently) or small files that are separated in too many units (e.g., 30 files or more). 
Feel free to use the codes in this repository for personal or office purposes.
